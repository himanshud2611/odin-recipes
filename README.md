# odin-recipes
In this project I have listed recipes by Chef Odin.This is index.html
In the home page of website there are 3 relative link to different recipe web pages,the folder name is recipes.
In recipes there are different files for different recipes viz. cupcake.html, salad.html and asparagus.html.
Each on eof it includes, recipe image, description, nutrition fact, ingredients,steps to make it,etc.

I have learned:
html links and attributes
use case of lists
web page styling
use case of git and github.
